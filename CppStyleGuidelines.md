An indicative C++ reference guideline is published [here](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).

While I agree with most of what written in this document, I disagree with a few points.

Whether you are a contributor, a project member or simply sending a patch, be sure that the new code is compliant with the guidelines. However, if you are not sure, send the patch anyway: we will review it and make the necessary changes.
