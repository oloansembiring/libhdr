Massively inspired by [pfslib/pfstools/pfstmo/pfscalibration](http://pfstools.sourceforge.net/), this newly designed library aim to create an organic API that will make available HDR image functionalities to the open source community.

# Status #
Currently the project is to considered **UNSTABLE**

# Implementation details #

Most of the implementation details are (or will be) documented in the Wiki page. My personal aim is to create an evolving library to cover every aspect of HDRi in a coherent way.
